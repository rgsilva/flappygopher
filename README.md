# Flappy Gopher

This is a test project for running Golang in the PlayStation 2.
A proper write-up is provided [here]().

## Disclaimer

I am no game developer. This is a hobby/for fun project, and as such, everything is provided _AS IS_.

## Building

Currently this requires a custom version of the TinyGo compiler. This will be released on a later date. Until then,
you can use this [precompiled binary](https://rgsilva-files.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/flappygopher-20250420.elf).
